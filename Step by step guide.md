+ Deploy Static content to the pages (it allows for easy hosting of static websites directly from GitHub repositories. Using Jekyll and a CI/CD pipeline like GitHub Actions automates the build and deployment process, ensuring the site is always current.)

**Step 5 -**
After configuring it, you can check if it is working or not by making some minor changes, it will automate the deploy, testing and other processes.

**Step 6 -**
Click on Actions, and go to the recent update, it will show you a link, copy it and paste it on a new tab.

**Step 7 -**
Now, you can refresh it after every update and check for the changes made in the web application.

### **Congratulations!! you have successfully implemented CI/CD PipelineðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰**

**Note - With this, you can check who and when made the chang**es.
